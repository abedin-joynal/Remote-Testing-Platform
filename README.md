# Remote Testing Platform
Originally developed for Air Dresser Device, this application allows to remote access and test any device with serial connectivity.
The server is connected to the actual device with serial Cable. And a webcam is connected to the server PC as well for viewing. 
A client (the user/tester) can remotely connect to the system and test the device by sending commands using serial communication and can see the live view of the device.
